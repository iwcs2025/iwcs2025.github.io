Alexander Koller is a Professor of Computational Linguistics at
Saarland University in Saarbr√ºcken, Germany. His research interests
include planning and reasoning with LLMs, syntactic and semantic
processing, natural language generation, and dialogue systems. He is
particularly interested in neurosymbolic models that bring together
principled linguistic modeling and correctness guarantees with the
coverage and robustness of neural approaches. Alexander received his
PhD from Saarland University and was previously a postdoc at Columbia
University and the University of Edinburgh, faculty at the University
of Potsdam, and Visiting Senior Research Scientist at the Allen
Institute for AI.

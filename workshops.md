Call for Workshops
=====


We invite proposals for workshops to be held in conjunction with IWCS 2025. Accepted workshops will have the option to publish their proceedings in the ACL Anthology.

We solicit proposals in all areas of computational semantics, in other words all computational aspects of meaning of natural language within written, spoken, signed, or multi-modal communication. Workshops are invited on these closely related areas, including the following:

* design of meaning representations
* syntax-semantics interface
* representing and resolving semantic ambiguity
* shallow and deep semantic processing and reasoning
* hybrid symbolic and statistical approaches to semantics
* distributional semantics
* alternative approaches to compositional semantics
* inference methods for computational semantics
* recognizing textual entailment
* learning by reading
* methodologies and practices for semantic annotation
* machine learning of semantic structures
* probabilistic computational semantics
* neural semantic parsing
* computing meaning with large language models
* computational aspects of lexical semantics
* semantics and ontologies
* semantic web and natural language processing
* semantic aspects of language generation
* generating from meaning representations
* semantic relations in discourse and dialogue
* semantics and pragmatics of dialogue acts
* multimodal and grounded approaches to computing meaning
* semantics-pragmatics interface
* applications of computational semantics

SUBMISSION INFORMATION
------

Proposals for workshops should contain:
* A title and brief (max two pages) description of the workshop topic and content;
* The names, affiliation and email addresses of the organisers;
* An estimate of the expected audience size;
* If the workshop has been held before, a note specifying where previous workshops were held, how many submissions the workshop received, how many papers were accepted and how many attendees the workshop attracted;
* Whether you plan a half-day or full-day workshop;
* Whether or not the workshop proceedings should be published in the ACL Anthology.

Proposals should be submitted on OpenReview <a href="https://openreview.net/group?id=aclweb.org/SIGSEM/IWCS/2025/Workshop_Proposals" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.
    

The person submitting the proposal will need an OpenReview account. Please note OpenReview's moderation policy, where newly created accounts with an institutional email address are approved automatically, but other email addresses can take up to two weeks to approve.

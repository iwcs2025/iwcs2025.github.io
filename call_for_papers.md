Call For Papers
========

We invite paper submissions in all areas of computational semantics, in other words all computational aspects of meaning of natural language within written, spoken, signed, or multi-modal communication. Submissions are invited on these closely related areas:

- design of meaning representations
- syntax-semantics interface
- representing and resolving semantic ambiguity
- shallow and deep semantic processing and reasoning
- hybrid symbolic and statistical approaches to semantics
- distributional semantics
- alternative approaches to compositional semantics
- inference methods for computational semantics
- recognising textual entailment
- learning by reading
- methodologies and practices for semantic annotation
- machine learning of semantic structures
- probabilistic computational semantics
- neural semantic parsing
- computing meaning with large language models
- computational aspects of lexical semantics
- semantics and ontologies
- semantic web and natural language processing
- semantic aspects of language generation
- generating from meaning representations
- semantic relations in discourse and dialogue
- semantics and pragmatics of dialogue acts
- multimodal and grounded approaches to computing meaning
- semantics-pragmatics interface
- applications of computational semantics

Submission Information:
---------------

Two types of submission are solicited: long papers and short papers. Both types should be submitted no later than 06 June 2025 (anywhere on earth).

Long papers should describe original research and must not exceed 8 pages. Short papers (typically system or project descriptions, or ongoing research) must not exceed 4 pages. Acknowledgments, references, a limitations section (optional), an ethics statement (optional), and a technical appendix (optional, not subject to reviewing) do not count towards the page limit. Accepted papers get an extra page in the camera-ready version and will be published in the conference proceedings in the ACL Anthology. For inclusion in the proceedings, at least one author must register to the conference and present the paper in person. Papers will be accepted either for oral presentation or for a poster presentation.

Submissions should be fully anonymous to ensure double-blind reviewing.

### Style Files:

IWCS 2025 papers should be formatted following the common two-column structure as used by IWCS 2021 (borrowed from ACL 2021). Please use these specific style-files or the Overleaf template.

Style files: <a href="https://iwcs2021.github.io/download/iwcs2021-templates.zip">https://iwcs2021.github.io/download/iwcs2021-templates.zip</a>

### Submitting:

Papers should be submitted in PDF format.

Please contact the program chairs if you have problems using OpenReview.

### No Anonymity Period:

IWCS 2025 does not have an anonymity period. However, we ask you to be reasonable and not publicly advertise your preprint during (or right before) review.

### Double Submission Policy:

Papers that have been or will be submitted to other meetings or publications must indicate this at submission time. Authors of papers accepted for presentation at IWCS 2025 must notify the program chairs by the camera-ready deadline as to whether the paper will be presented. All accepted papers must be presented at the conference to appear in the proceedings. We will not accept for publication or presentation papers that overlap significantly in content or results with papers that will be (or have been) published elsewhere.

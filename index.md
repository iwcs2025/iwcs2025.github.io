---

The 16th International Conference on Computational Semantics (IWCS) will be organized by Heinrich Heine University (HHU) and will take place at DÃ¼sseldorf, Germany from 22 to 24 September 2025.

IWCS is a biennial conference on computational semantics. The conference is endorsed by SIGSEM, the ACL Special Interest Group on Computational Semantics. The aim of IWCS is to bring together researchers interested in any aspects of the computation, annotation, extraction, representation, and learning of meaning in natural language, whether this is from a lexical or structural semantic perspective. IWCS embraces both symbolic and machine learning approaches to computational semantics, and everything in between.
